Ok, I slowly get why this is useful - but in the end... 

... it would have been super easy to get from a bunch of markdown files to a website. And the whole "you don't need a database!", well... of course you don't. Storing each blog post in its own file is a totally sensible thing to do. In the end, I feel like I could have pretty much written the same thing as a react app and used some other publishing flow (maybe as simple as scp'ing it onto my webspace).

Well, now I have the thing partly set up and will play with it some more. Maybe I will get to a point where it actually looks nice, and then I can actually make some use of it.
