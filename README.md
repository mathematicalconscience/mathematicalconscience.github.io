This about the most complex workflow I have ever seen to turn a piece of markdown into a deployed website.
But at least it is now version controlled (which it would have been anyway, as I have almost everything that gets deployed somewhere in a git repo) and the publishing is automatic via a github workflow (which is nice I suppose).

After not having done any development in this environment for quite a bit, it was good to update my knowledge of some stuff (ssh keys, git workflows). A bit sad that this was mostly a tangent to a tangent to a tangent while I was _really_ working on some fast.ai stuff.
